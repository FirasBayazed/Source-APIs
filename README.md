# web-scraping
We'll scrap already downloaded html data from https://www.rottentomatoes.com/ site.

The rt_html folder contains the Rotten Tomatoes HTML for each of the Top 100 Movies of All Time as the list stood at the most recent update of this lesson. I'm giving you these historical files because the ratings will change over time and there will be inconsistencies with the recorded lesson videos. Also, a web page's HTML is known to change over time. Scraping code can break easily when web redesigns occur, which makes scraping brittle and not recommended for projects with longevity. So just use these HTML files provided to you and pretend like you saved them yourself with one of the methods described above.
